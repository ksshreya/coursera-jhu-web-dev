            <p>Sev puri is an Indian snack and a type of chaat. It is a speciality that originates
                from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. In Pune and Mumbai, sev puri is strongly associated with street
                food, but is also served at upscale locations. As of today, supermarkets in India and around the
                world have started stocking ready-to-eat packets of sev puri and similar snacks like bhelpuri. Sev puri
                is essentially made of crispy papdi (flat puri) which is loaded with diced potatoes, chickpeas, onions,
                tomatoes and various types of chutneys. Some popular chutneys used include spicy mint and coriander,
                sweet-sour tamarind, chili and garlic.

            <div class="food-title soya-chaap-biryani">Soya Chaap Biryani</div>
            <p>Soya chaap biryani is a vegetarian variation of the popular Indian biryani dish, featuring soya chaap as
                the main protein source. Soya chaap is a popular vegetarian alternative to meat, often made with a
                combination of soya flour and refined wheat flour. The dish is prepared by layering cooked rice
                with a flavorful soya chaap masala and then slow-cooked or dum-cooked to allow the flavors to meld
                together. The fried soya chaap is layered with fragrant basmati rice that has been cooked with aromatic
                spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves. The dish is then cooked using the dum method
                (sealed and slow-cooked) to allow the flavors to meld together.

        <div class="food-section section-three">
            <div class="food-title ratatouille">Ratatouille</div>
            <p>The word ratatouille derives from the Occitan ratatolha and is related to the French ratouiller
                and tatouiller, expressive forms of the verb touiller, meaning "to stir up". From the late
                18th century, in French, it merely indicated a coarse stew. Modern ratatouille uses tomatoes as a
                foundation for sautéed garlic, onion, zucchini, eggplant, bell pepper,
                marjoram, fennel and basil. Instead of basil, bay leaf and thyme, or a mix of green herbs like
                herbes de Provence can be used. The modern version does not appear in print until c. 1930. The Larousse
                Gastronomique says, "according to the purists, the different vegetables should be cooked separately,
                then combined and cooked slowly together until they attain a smooth, creamy consistency", so that
                (according to the chair of the Larousse's committee, Joël Robuchon) "each [vegetable] will taste truly
                of itself."
